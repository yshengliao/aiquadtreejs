## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **`retrieveInto(region: AABB, target: T[]): T[]`** — zero-allocation
  variant of `retrieve` for hot-path callers. Clears `target`, walks
  the same iterative DFS + Set dedup as `retrieve`, writes results
  into `target`, returns `target`. The returned reference equals the
  argument — callers can hold a permanent buffer and pass it every
  frame to eliminate the result-array allocation churn (5,000+ calls
  per frame in typical bullet-hell broadphase loops).
- **`STABILITY.md`** — explicit stable vs experimental API tracking.
  Includes a v0.6+ 3D octree draft (no source code in this release).
- **Property-based tests** via `fast-check` — 4 invariants covering
  `retrieve` dedup and `retrieveInto` identity / length / content
  equivalence. Adds `fast-check` to `devDependencies`.

### Changed

- **`Quadtree.clear` JSDoc** — corrected the claim that "internal
  node objects are reused across frames"; only the root node is
  reused, child nodes are released on `clear()` and re-created when
  subdivision next triggers. No runtime behaviour change.
- **README Roadmap / Status / API sketch** — synced to v0.3.0,
  including the `retrieveInto(region, target)` signature (the
  pre-0.2 Roadmap entry was a single-argument draft).

### Notes

- `retrieve` behaviour is byte-for-byte identical to 0.1.1: the
  internal refactor extracts a shared `retrieveSet` helper that both
  `retrieve` and `retrieveInto` call, but `Set` insertion order →
  `Array.from` order is preserved by spec.
- Bundle size: ≤ 2 KB gzip budget still ~50% headroom after this
  release (expected ~1050-1090 B gzip).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-28

### Changed (CI)

- **`publish.yml` now triggers on `push: tags: ["v*"]`** (was `workflow_dispatch` only). Aligns with the trigger used by `aifsmjs` / `aiecsjs` / `aibridgejs`. Tag push now automatically runs the OIDC trusted publish.
- **`npm publish --provenance --access public`** — the workflow now emits a [sigstore provenance attestation](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements) so consumers can verify the tarball was built by this workflow on this commit.

No runtime / source / API changes from 0.1.0. **0.1.1 is also the first version to actually land on npm — 0.1.0 was tagged in git but never published to npm.** Production bundles are byte-identical to the 0.1.0 git tag.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- `createQuadtree({ bounds, maxObjects, maxLevels })` factory — 2D AABB broadphase.
- `insert(obj)` / `retrieve(region)` / `clear()` / `dispose()` lifecycle.
- Set-based dedup on `retrieve()` so objects spanning multiple quadrants are returned once.
- Per-frame rebuild model — `clear()` reuses internal node objects (zero GC churn frame-to-frame).
- `disposed` read-only flag; post-dispose calls throw `QuadtreeDisposedError`.
- Test coverage ≥95% statements / lines / functions / ≥90% branches (~30 it() blocks, groups A–H).
- Size budget: ≤2 KB gzip.
- Dual ESM + CJS build via `tsup` with `minify: true`; `sideEffects: false`; zero runtime dependencies.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-05-28

### Added (scaffold)

- Full package scaffold landed (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`,
  `tsconfig.test.json`, `tsup.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `biome.json`,
  `scripts/{verify-exports,check-size,build-llms-full}.mjs`,
  `test/scaffold.test.ts`, `examples/.gitkeep`, `.github/workflows/{ci,publish}.yml`,
  `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`).
- `src/index.ts` remains a `throw` stub exposing the frozen 0.1.0 API surface
  (`createQuadtree`, `Quadtree<T>`, `QuadtreeOptions`, `AABB`,
  `QuadtreeError`, `QuadtreeDisposedError`).
- `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm coverage && pnpm build &&
  pnpm verify:exports && pnpm verify:llms && pnpm check:size` walks clean
  against a single placeholder test.
- Coverage thresholds temporarily set to `0/0/0/0`; tightened to
  `95/90/100/100` in 0.1.0 with real tests.
- Size budget temporarily set to 3 KB gzip; tightened to the 2 KB README
  target in 0.1.0.
- Publish workflow exists but trigger is `workflow_dispatch` only — no
  accidental npm release on tag push until 0.1.0.
